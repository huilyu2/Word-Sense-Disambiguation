\section{Solution Methods}

For this multi-class classification problem, we consider the following models,
using one-vs-all method to extend them to solve multi-class problem:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Naive Bayes.
  \item Logistic Regression.
  \item Support Vector Machine.
  \item Neural Networks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Desired properties}. Since in our system design, we need to train a
classifier for each target word, the ideal method should have short training
time, and compact model representation.

\textbf{Performance Measure}. For each target word, we partition the data into
training set and test set. And evaluate classifiers on the training set using
0-1 loss.
