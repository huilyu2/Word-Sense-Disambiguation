\Paragraph{Support Vector Machine}
\\We have built three types of SVM models for each target word: Linear SVM, RBF kernel SVM and Polynomial kernel SVM. For the purpose of multi-class classification task, we use the \texttt{svm.SVC()} method in \texttt{sklearn} module in Python. Specifically, we set the \texttt{kernel} attribute in \texttt{svm.SVC()} to be ``linear'', ``rbf'' and ``poly'' respectively for building the three types of SVM models.
