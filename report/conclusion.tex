\section{Conclusion}

We solve the word sense disambiguation problem using supervised learning
methods, 
We gather training data by generate feature instances and labels from
hand-tagged Corpus with word meaning defined by WordNet.
We evaluated multiple multi-class classification medels and algorithms on this
dataset, the result shows that Logistic Regression is the best all-around
algorithm to solve this word-sense classification problem, considering 
training time, model complexity, and the overall performance based on F1-score.

\Paragraph{Neural network underfit issue}. 
Because the dataset is very small, the simplified neural
network model remains severely underfit. More data is required to train the
model in order to improve the performance instead of adding more features into
the dataset. The network was originally designed for the whole sentence
processing, so as long as given a sufficient dataset, there is a huge potential
to give a better result. For future work, each dilation block could be replaced
by LSTM, which is also proven strong at time series type data processing.
