\section{Dataset}
We use Semcor~\cite{semcor} to generate our dataset.
Semcor is a Corpus that consist of a set of tagged sentences.
The tags provided with each word.
The tag information we used in this work includes: \\
(1) Word sense ID in WordNet~\cite{wordnet}, which is used as prediction label.\\
(2) Part-of-Speech tag. This is used to encode context.\\
(3) Lemma. This is used to remove the inflections of word form variations in
different contexts.\\ 
Specifically, in our work, we use lemma, instead of the word
itself, as the identifier for word occurrence counting.
However, in context representation, we use the original word.

Class imbalance is prevalent in ambiguous words.
Most words have some rare meanings with very few occurrences in the corpus.
This ends up minority class in the dataset: classes that only appears in a few
times (typicall less than ten times).

We discuss how we account for the class imbalance issues in our evaluation
(section~\ref{sec:eval:results}).
