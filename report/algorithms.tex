\section{Model and Algorithms}

For this multi-class classification problem, we consider the following models,
using one-vs-all method to extend them to solve multi-class problem:

\Paragraph{Naive Bayes}

\input{logistic_regression}

\input{svm}

\input{neural_network}

\textbf{Desired properties}. Since in our system design, we need to train a
classifier for each target word, the ideal method should have short training
time, and compact model representation.
