\Paragraph{Neural Network}
Since the feature contains the sentence structure, the model is designed to
process having capability of recognize which word come first and later instead
up allowing model randomly search the best combination. Causal convolution layer
\cite{oord2016pixel}, a type of convolution, has been used in this problem to
maintain this time series like structure. In order to having a larger size of
reception field, dilation blocks are used, in which each layer extract certain
amount of feature with sequence information \cite{van2016wavenet}, so that it is
quite possible to process a much longer sentence without changing the structure
with additional information. Residual network structure \cite{he2016deep} has
been used on dilation block to prevent gradient vanishing in deep network. \\ 
The overall model structure is a forward causal layer to process sentence in a
forward sequence, followed by two dilation residual blocks. There is a parallel
structure to process the sentence backward. Two dilation blocks skip connections
on both sequence are concatenated, then into a fully connected layer and enters
a Softmax layer to make classification prediction.
